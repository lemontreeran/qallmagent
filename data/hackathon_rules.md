Judging may take place in one or more rounds with one or more panels of Judges, at the discretion of the Sponsor. 

Stage One) The first stage will determine via pass/fail whether the ideas meet a baseline level of viability, in that the project reasonably fits a Prize Category as outlined in Section 8 Prizes and the Project and Submission Requirements featured in the Hackathon.

Stage Two) All submissions that pass Stage One will be evaluated in Stage Two for each Prize Category based on the following equally weighted criteria (the “Judging Criteria”):

Entries will be judged on the following equally weighted criteria, and according to the sole and absolute discretion of the judges:

*   Business Relevance: Does the solution address a specific, real-world business challenge or opportunity?
    
*   Creativity: Is the solution unique or does it introduce a novel approach to an existing problem?
    
*   Potential Impact: How effectively does the project deliver measurable value (e.g. increased efficiency, cost savings, revenue growth)?
    
*   Design: Is the user experience and design of the project well thought out?
    
*   Technical Implementation: Does the solution demonstrate quality software development?
    

The scores from the Judges will determine the potential winners for each Prize Category. The Entrant(s) that are eligible for a Prize, and whose Submissions earn the highest overall scores for each Prize Category based on the applicable Judging Criteria, will become potential winners of that Prize Category.

Tie Breaking. For each Prize Category listed below, if two or more Submissions are tied, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first applicable criterion listed above will be considered the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated, as needed, by comparing the tied Submissions’ scores on the next applicable criterion. If two or more Submissions are tied on all applicable criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied Submissions.

**Community Prize - Public Voting** During the Voting Period, eligible Submissions will be posted on the Hackathon Website for community members to submit their votes. Voting results will not be displayed publicly. The winners of the Community Prize will be selected based on the highest number of verified votes received during the Voting Period.
