**Submission **

Submitting your hackathon project is a crucial final step that encapsulates all your hard work. Ensure your submission clearly demonstrates the problem you're solving, the innovative technology applied, and the potential impact on your target audience or industry. 



**Demonstration Video **

Creating a solid demo is crucial to effectively communicate the value and potential of your project. A great demo should be clear, engaging, and showcase your solution's core functionality in a compelling way. To help you craft a standout demo, consider these expert resources: 

● The Art of a Salesforce Demo | Admin Best Practices 

● Build a Great Technical Demo 

● How to Rock Your Next Presentation and Demo 

Your demonstration video can include slides to set the context of your use case and introduce the key features of your solution and the technical approach you used. The use of slides is optional, we recommend dedicating your time and efforts to your demo video. 

There is no need to capture your video for the recordings, demos should be full screen. 

Here is an example of an Agentforce demo video that meets the Hackathon submission requirements: 

● Mochi Cupcakes | Agentforce Decoded: In this Agentforce Decoded video, we'll take a look at a use case for a fictional bakery, Mochi Cupcakes, using Agentforce. In this example, we're using the power of Agentforce, Prompt Builder, and Flow to solve challenges with making recommendations for baking classes based on past behavior and assisting with product suggestions based on dietary restrictions/customer preferences.

**Video Creation Tools **

Your demonstration video should include a narrated screen recording of your demo. You can use any screen recording tool you're comfortable with, however we recommend using a tool like Quicktime Player or Camtasia that does not add watermarks to your video. If you're unfamiliar with screen recording tools, consider these options: **Using Quicktime for Recordings **

Windows users can refer to these instructions to install QuickTime Player on a PC. Mac users can open QuickTime Player from the Applications folder, then choose File > New Screen Recording from the menu bar. 

● Before starting your recording, you can click the arrow next to the Record button to change the recording settings: 

○ To allow viewers to follow along by showing a black circle around your pointer when you click, choose Show Mouse Clicks in Recording. 

● To start recording, click the Record button and then take one of these actions: 

○ Click anywhere on the screen to begin recording the entire screen. 

○ Drag to select an area to record, then click Start Recording within that area. 

○ To stop recording, click the Stop button in the menu bar, or press Command-Control-Esc \(Escape\). 

○ After you stop recording, QuickTime Player automatically opens the recording. You can now play, edit, or share the recording. 

**Tips for recording the best demo: **

● Record your screen with a resolution of at least 1080p. The MacBook retina display has a different resolution, if you need to change it, use** SwitchReSX** to adapt the resolution before recording.❗ 

● Ensure that your recording meets accessibility standards: 

○ High-Contrast Accessible themes in Chrome, VS Code, to ensure the color schemes you use are easy to read by people with different abilities. 

○ Min 20 px font size \(slides, VS Code, terminal...\). 

● Do not use generative AI video or audio tools when recording. 

● Do not use third party trademarks, copyrighted music, or other material. 

● Do not edit or manipulate Salesforce characters \(including Einstein\).
